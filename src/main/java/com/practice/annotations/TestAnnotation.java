    Metadata is information about information
    Annotations, via metadata, enable us to add value to our code
    We can annotate (assign metadata) to classes, methods variable etc..

    Annotations operate much like interfaces. In fact, their origins are in interfaces.
    Their "elements" looks like abstract methods.
    Annotations names are case-sensitive
    It is common practice to start the name with an uppercase letter
    Like interfaces, annotations can be applied to unrelated classes
